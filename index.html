        <h2>Junior - Bob Jones University</h2>
        
         <p>Welcome to my website! I am currently a junior at Bob Jones University studying Interior Architecture and Design, which covers everything from residential design to commercial design, fabrics to finishes, AutoCAD to Revit, and ergonomics to proxemics. I work for the Study Abroad department as their student assistant, assisting in student communication, registration, data organization, and more.</p>
         <p>
            When I'm not working on school projects, I love to travel (whether locally or internationally), listen to 80s music, and watch murder mysteries (Psych anyone?).
